## Project Overview
The Cryptanalysis & Security Testing Toolkit is a Python-based application developed as part of the BIT4138 Advanced Cryptography unit. The toolkit goes beyond basic encryption by analyzing and exposing weaknesses in cipher implementations. It covers classical ciphers, stream ciphers, block ciphers, asymmetric encryption and cryptanalysis techniques.

## Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1 — Environment Setup
Installation and configuration of Python, VS Code, PyCryptodome, OpenSSL and GitHub repository initialization.

### Week 2 — Classical Cryptography
Implementation of Caesar and Vigenère cipher modules with user input validation and cipher testing suite.

### Week 3 — Stream Ciphers & Randomness Testing
LFSR pseudorandom generator and RC4 stream cipher implemented. Frequency, Runs and Mean statistical tests performed to validate randomness quality.

### Week 4 — Block Ciphers & AES
AES encryption and decryption implemented using CBC mode with random IV generation, PKCS padding and secure key generation. File encryption demonstrated.

### Week 5 — Asymmetric Encryption & RSA
RSA 2048-bit key pair generation implemented with public key encryption and private key decryption. Secure message transmission simulated and validated through a full testing suite.

### Creativity — Frequency Analysis Visualizer
A real-world cryptanalysis technique implemented using Matplotlib to visualize letter frequency distributions in ciphertext, exposing weaknesses in classical cipher implementations.
